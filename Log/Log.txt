- Moving to Iteration 11 Monday 21-06-2010
- Show stopper encountered in trying to do navigation (info sharing)
- Show stopper encountered in trying to do navigation (sizers don't work)


- Fixed showstopper - 'odd' strings in db using text_factory = str

- 23-06-2010: Indexed Dr Magee's drive.
- 24-06-2010: reigned myself in (on supervisor advice). Now attacking navigation using a small prototype without viz (i.e. using buttons and textctrls - see drilldown.py) and an index of Khoi's new drive 
- 26-06-2010: Drilldown.py completed and working like a charm. Generates data fro each level on request and maintains forward and backward history. Now to convert to visual mode.
- 27-06-2010: Excellent breakthrough. Created DBManager as a separate moduule and refactored code such that no need to order master data from db and also eliminated a lot of code in lvl0data. No longer needs to group data itself.
- Looked into the crosshairs tutorial example. May be useful for tooltips later. Also noted the bbc worldcup schedule. Good, informative tooltips there.
28-06-2010: Fixed a major bug of partial repaint. All I had to do was trap the size event and clear the screen there insted of using only the paint event.
28-06-2010: Drilldown visual conversion 50% complete. Clicking and navigation yet to be done.


WIP
-------
- level two should have the option to discarding the extensions and switching to 	full data set based on attributes like date created, date modified etc.
- Right-click to select or deselect
- Look into implementing the tabs per concept idea
- Start work on the search engine
- Aside: look into the scroll thing
- How about the structure between the visualizations and the search.
- update createfileindex to get all attributes of each file during walk (use os.stat)
- Create a listctrl that recieves a list of files and displays them with generic/random icons.
- New window for date range only. This one should have a dynamic level constructor thus the layers must be fixed.
- Update the index creator to handle long pathnames (find some way to target the file without traversing the long pathname)
- Update the artist to ignore drawing bars for zero names in the day level



Challenges:
-----------
- WxPython is unwilling to embed a sizer (containing three windows).
	this is looking like a major showstopper because my design is based on a notebook
	and I intended to use a main window in each page as a container for all objects within the page.
- The solution appears to lie in converting the different window classes (e.g. Histwindow etc) to panels.
	this will the crux of activities in the 10th iteration including development of a basic search class
	and a brief foray into the word of tag clouds.

HOw to get deeply embedded classes to share info with higher level classes of other classes deeply embedded elsewhere.
