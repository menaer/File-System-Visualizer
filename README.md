# Plot My Files (File System Visualizer)
Alternative Visualization for file system navigation (Alternative for Windows Explorer)
This is something I've been hoping to work on since 2010. Hope to get it sorted this year.
An alternative to Windows Explorer. A file system navigator that utilizes an alternate visualization to view the file system.
The goal is to address the challenges of the normal tree-based file system. I will update this Readme with more information
soon.
