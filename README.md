# Plot My Files (File System Visualizer)
<b>Proposed Alternative Visualization for File Management and System Navigation</b>

This is a project I started working on in 2010. An alternative to Windows Explorer ! A file managerthat utilizes an alternate visualization to view the file system. The goal is to address the challenges of the normal tree-based file system found in popular navigators such as Window's Explorer and Nautilus.
